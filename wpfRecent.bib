	abstract = {Graph clustering has been a hot research topic and is widely used in many fields, such as community detection in social networks. Lots of works combining auto-encoder and graph neural networks have been applied to clustering tasks by utilizing node attributes and graph structure. These works usually assumed the inherent parameters (i.e., size and variance) of different clusters in the latent embedding space are homogeneous, and hence the assigned probability is monotonous over the Euclidean distance between node embeddings and centroids. Unfortunately, this assumption usually does not hold since the size and concentration of different clusters can be quite different, which limits the clustering accuracy. In addition, the node embeddings in deep graph clustering methods are usually L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hyper-sphere. To solve this problem, we proposed

              lustering via von Mises-Fisher distributions, namely DAGC. DAGC assumes the node embeddings
              
                H
              
              can be drawn from a von Mises-Fisher distribution and each cluster
              k
              is associated with cluster inherent parameters

              which includes cluster center
              Œº
              and cluster cohesion degree Œ∫. Then we adopt an EM-like approach (i.e., ùí´(

                H
              
              ), respectively) to learn the embedding and cluster inherent parameters alternately. Specifically, with the node embeddings, we proposed to update the cluster centers in an attraction-repulsion manner to make the cluster centers more separable. And given the cluster inherent parameters, a likelihood-based loss is proposed to make node embeddings more concentrated around cluster centers. Thus, DAGC can simultaneously improve the intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster heterogeneity. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed DAGC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially on imbalanced datasets.},

	abstract = {This article studies the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs, which aims to incorporate ubiquitous unlabeled knowledge (e.g., graph topology, node attributes) with few-available labeled knowledge (e.g., node class) to alleviate the scarcity issue of supervised information on node classification. While promising results are achieved, existing works for this problem usually suffer from the poor balance of generalization and fitting ability due to the heavy reliance on labels or task-agnostic unsupervised information. To address the challenge, we propose a dual-channel framework for semi-supervised learning on

              ransfer between independent supervised and unsupervised embedding spaces, namely, GKT. Specifically, we devise a dual-channel framework including a supervised model for learning the label probability of nodes and an unsupervised model for extracting information from massive unlabeled graph data. A knowledge transfer head is proposed to bridge the gap between the generalization and fitting capability of the two models. We use the unsupervised information to reconstruct batch-graphs to smooth the label probability distribution on the graphs to improve the generalization of prediction. We also adaptively adjust the reconstructed graphs by encouraging the label-related connections to solidify the fitting ability. Since the optimization of the supervised channel with knowledge transfer contains that of the unsupervised channel as a constraint and vice versa, we then propose a meta-learning-based method to solve the bi-level optimization problem, which avoids the negative transfer and further improves the model‚Äôs performance. Finally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by comparing state-of-the-art algorithms.},
