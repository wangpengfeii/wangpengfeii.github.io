abstract: Abstract Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common and fatal subtype
  of ovarian malignancies, with no effective therapeutics available. Our previous
  studies have demonstrated extraordinary suppressive efficacy of enterolactone (ENL)
  on EOC. A chemotherapeutic agent, trabectedin (Trabe), is shown to be effective
  on ovarian cancer, especially when combined with other therapeutics, such as pegylated
  liposomal doxorubicin or oxaliplatin. Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), a kind of matrix
  glycoprotein, plays important roles against cancer development through inhibiting
  angiogenesis but whether it is involved in the suppression of EOC by ENL or Trabe
  remains unknown. To test combined suppressive effects of ENL and Trabe on EOC and
  possible involvement of THBS1 in the anticancer activities of ENL and Trabe. The
  EOC cell line ES‐2 was transfected with overexpressed THBS1 by lentivirus vector.
  We employed tube formation assay to evaluate the anti‐angiogenesis activity of ENL
  and of its combined use with Trabe after THBS1 overexpression and established drug
  intervention and xenograft nude mouse cancer models to assess the in vivo effects
  of the hypothesized synergistic suppression between the agents and the involvement
  of THBS1. Mouse fecal samples were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing and microbiota
  analysis. We detected strong inhibitory activities of ENL and Trabe against the
  proliferation and migration of cancer cells and observed synergistic effects between
  ENL and Trabe in suppressing EOC. ENL and Trabe, given either separately or in combination,
  could suppress the tube formation capability of human microvascular endothelial
  cells, and this inhibitory effect became even stronger with THBS1 overexpression.
  In the ENL plus Trabe combination group, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  3 and cluster of differentiation 36 was both upregulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinase
  9, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cluster of differentiation 47 were all
  decreased. With the overexpression of THBS1, the results became even more pronounced.
  In animal experiments, combined use of ENL and Trabe showed superior inhibitory
  effects to either single agent and significantly suppressed tumor growth, and the
  overexpression of THBS1 further enhanced the anti‐cancer activities of the drug
  combination group. ENL and Trabe synergistically suppress EOC and THBS1 could remarkably
  facilitate the synergistic anticancer effects of ENL and Trabe.
