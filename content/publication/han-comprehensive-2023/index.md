abstract: A vector database is used to store high-dimensional data that cannot be
  characterized by traditional DBMS. Although there are not many articles describing
  existing or introducing new vector database architectures, the approximate nearest
  neighbor search problem behind vector databases has been studied for a long time,
  and considerable related algorithmic articles can be found in the literature. This
  article attempts to comprehensively review relevant algorithms to provide a general
  understanding of this booming research area. The basis of our framework categorises
  these studies by the approach of solving ANNS problem, respectively hash-based,
  tree-based, graph-based and quantization-based approaches. Then we present an overview
  of existing challenges for vector databases. Lastly, we sketch how vector databases
  can be combined with large language models and provide new possibilities.
