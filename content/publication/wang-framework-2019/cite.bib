 abstract = {With the development of technology, more and more data have been accumulated. Utilization of data can benefit many applications, such as facilitate human daily life, promote scientific research, and expedite event detection etc. How to share data within a certain group or a specific person securely and effectively has become a hot research topic. Meanwhile, many distributed technologies have appeared with the triggering of many centralized cloud web services. Thus, we propose a block-chain based data sharing framework with IPFS (https://ipfs.io/), Ethereum (https://www.ethereum.org/) and uPort (https://www.uport.me/). As a result of this design, the system could store data in IPFS system and control sensitive data by block-chain, and the authentication can be managed by the uPort ID system. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness by a case study.},
