abstract: Urban traffic light control is an important and challenging real-world problem.
  By regarding intersections as agents, most of the reinforcement learning-based methods
  generate agents’ actions independently. They can cause action conflict and result
  in overflow or road resource waste in adjacent intersections. Recently, some collaborative
  methods have alleviated the above problems by extending the observable surroundings
  of agents, which can be considered inactive cross-agent communication methods. However,
  when agents act synchronously in these works, the perceived action value is biased,
  and the information exchanged is insufficient. In this work, we first propose a
  novel Multi-agent Communication and Action Rectification (MaCAR) framework. It enables
  active communication between agents by considering the impact of synchronous actions
  of agents. Another fundamental problem of traffic light control is the balance between
  traffic demand and road supply capacity. To fully describe the relation between
  traffic demand and road supply capacity (Supply-Demand modeling, SD), we further
  model and forecast the Supply-Demand relation to facilitating the effectiveness
  of the model’s action. The experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Combining the SD with MaCAR,
  SD-MaCAR can further boost the traffic light control performance even in traffic
  accident scenarios.
