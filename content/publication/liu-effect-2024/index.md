abstract: Compacted coal gangue is often used as subgrade soils in South Central China.
  To understand further the effects of drying–wetting (D-W) cycles on the hydromechanical
  behaviour of compacted coal gangue subgrade, this paper presents a series of laboratory
  test results on reconstituted coal gangue subjected to multiple D-W cycles. The
  effects of vertical load and compaction parameters on the soil deformation behaviours
  during hydraulic loading are fully discussed. Based on the laboratory investigations,
  the shrinkage strain was found to decrease with the increase in the initial dry
  density; however, it increased with the increase in vertical load. Experimental
  results also revealed that the variation in soil water content was more pronounced
  in the first D-W cycle. The characteristics of the void ratio and water content
  change during D-W cycles were investigated, and the shrinkage behaviour (e–w) was
  obtained. Significant hysteresis was detected during the D-W cycles, and the size
  of the hysteresis loop was found to decrease with the increase in D-W cycles, while
  it increased with the increase in vertical load. Besides, the D-W cycles were found
  to influence the pore volume at the microscopic scale, where both the volumes of
  inter-aggregate pores and intra-aggregate pores were found to decrease as the hydraulic
  loading increased.
