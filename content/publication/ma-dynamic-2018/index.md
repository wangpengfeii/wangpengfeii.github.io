abstract: Extracting appropriate features to represent a corpus is an important task
  for textual mining. Previous attention based work usually enhance feature at the
  lexical level, which lacks the exploration of feature augmentation at the sentence
  level. In this paper, we exploit a Dynamic Feature Generation Network (DFGN) to
  solve this problem. Specifically, DFGN generates features based on a variety of
  attention mechanisms and attaches features to sentence representation. Then a thresholder
  is designed to filter the mined features automatically. DFGN extracts the most significant
  characteristics from datasets to keep its practicability and robustness. Experimental
  results on multiple well-known answer selection datasets show that our proposed
  approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We give a detailed
  analysis of the experiments to illustrate why DFGN provides excellent retrieval
  and interpretative ability.
