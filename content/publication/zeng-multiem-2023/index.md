abstract: Entity Matching (EM), which aims to identify all entity pairs referring
  to the same real-world entity from relational tables, is one of the most important
  tasks in real-world data management systems. Due to the labeling process of EM being
  extremely labor-intensive, unsupervised EM is more applicable than supervised EM
  in practical scenarios. Traditional unsupervised EM assumes that all entities come
  from two tables; however, it is more common to match entities from multiple tables
  in practical applications, that is, multi-table entity matching (multi-table EM).
  Unfortunately, effective and efficient unsupervised multi-table EM remains under-explored.
  To fill this gap, this paper formally studies the problem of unsupervised multi-table
  entity matching and proposes an effective and efficient solution, termed as MultiEM.
  MultiEM is a parallelable pipeline of enhanced entity representation, table-wise
  hierarchical merging, and density-based pruning. Extensive experimental results
  on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiEM in terms
  of effectiveness and efficiency.
