Previous works, however, usually focus on improving model structure or algorithm for better performance but the perspective of learning proper numeric representations is overlooked. The inappropriate and coarse numeric representations are not expressive enough to capture the intrinsic characteristics of numbers, which will obviously degrade the prediction performance. In this article, we propose Num2vec, an algorithmic framework to learn numeric representations. Specifically, Num2vec lists three main logic characteristics of numbers: arithmetic, direction, and periodicity. By representing numbers into a transition space, Num2vec can translates numbers agilely to different Internet of Things tasks through selecting the corresponding characteristics. According to such a design, Num2vec enjoys flexible numeric representations to fit different Internet of Things time series tasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the approach achieves the best performance when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.","tags":null,"title":"Num2vec: Pre-Training Numeric Representations for Time Series Forecasting in the Sensing System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Chenliang Li","Lixin Zou","Zhichao Feng","Kaiyuan Li","Xiaochen Li","Xialong Liu","Shangguang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696118400,"objectID":"cde33cbfa4cd9bf6306862e739542a86","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-tutorial-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.978916Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-tutorial-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tutorial: Data Denoising Metrics in Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujia Gao","Pengfei Wang","Liang Liu","Chi Zhang","Huadong Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"a90014a59783cf747a09b7df0ec51657","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/gao-configure-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.763301Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gao-configure-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning framework, enables clients to conduct model training without transmitting their data to the server, which is used to solve the dilemma of data silos and data privacy. It can work well on clients having similar data characteristics and distribution. However, it has some limitations where the dataset of clients may be different in distribution, quantity, and concept in many application scenarios. Personalized federated learning is a new federated learning paradigm that aims to guarantee client personalized models’ effectiveness when collaborating with the cloud server. Intuitively, providing further facilitated collaborations for the clients with similar data characteristics and distribution can benefit personalized model building. However, due to the invisibility of client data, it is challenging to extract client characteristics and define collaborative relationships among them from a fine-grained view. Moreover, a reasonable collaborative training approach needs to be designed for a distributed server–client framework. In this article, we design a Hierarchical Attention-enhanced Meta-learning Network (HAM) to address this issue. The main advantage of HAM is that it utilizes the meta-learning approach of taking model parameters as features and learns to learn an extra model for each client to analyze similarities according to their local dataset automatically. According to its two-layers framework, HAM can reasonably achieve a tradeoff between clients’ personality and commonality and provides a hybrid model with useful information from all clients. Considering there are two networks (HAM and base network) that need to learn for each client during the federated training process, we then provide an alternative learning approach to train them in an end-to-end fashion. To further clarify the approach, we describe the personalized federated learning settings framework as FedHAM where the HAM network is distributed deployed in each client. Extensive experiments based on two datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under different evaluation metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Configure Your Federation: Hierarchical Attention-enhanced Meta-Learning Network for Personalized Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Teng-Yue Han","Peng-Fei Wang","Shao-Zhang Niu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"c40cb104751f3aeadeb15c8e9840638c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/han-multimodal-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.77838Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-multimodal-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal Interactive Network for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wayne Xin Zhao","Zihan Lin","Zhichao Feng","Pengfei Wang","Ji-Rong Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"eb987295545a3453d40b87967098ba3e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhao-revisiting-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.554703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhao-revisiting-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"In recommender systems, top- N recommendation is an important task with implicit feedback data. Although the recent success of deep learning largely pushes forward the research on top- N recommendation, there are increasing concerns on appropriate evaluation of recommendation algorithms. It therefore is important to study how recommendation algorithms can be reliably evaluated and thoroughly verified. This work presents a large-scale, systematic study on six important factors from three aspects for evaluating recommender systems. We carefully select 12 top- N recommendation algorithms and eight recommendation datasets. Our experiments are carefully designed and extensively conducted with these algorithms and datasets. In particular, all the experiments in our work are implemented based on an open sourced recommendation library, Recbole [ 139 ], which ensures the reproducibility and reliability of our results. Based on the large-scale experiments and detailed analysis, we derive several key findings on the experimental settings for evaluating recommender systems. Our findings show that some settings can lead to substantial or significant differences in performance ranking of the compared algorithms. In response to recent evaluation concerns, we also provide several suggested settings that are specially important for performance comparison.","tags":null,"title":"A Revisiting Study of Appropriate

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
