Lots of works combining auto-encoder and graph neural networks have been applied to clustering tasks by utilizing node attributes and graph structure. These works usually assumed the inherent parameters (i.e., size and variance) of different clusters in the latent embedding space are homogeneous, and hence the assigned probability is monotonous over the Euclidean distance between node embeddings and centroids. Unfortunately, this assumption usually does not hold since the size and concentration of different clusters can be quite different, which limits the clustering accuracy. In addition, the node embeddings in deep graph clustering methods are usually L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hyper-sphere. To solve this problem, we proposed  D  eep  A  daptive  G  raph  C  lustering via von Mises-Fisher distributions, namely DAGC. DAGC assumes the node embeddings  H  can be drawn from a von Mises-Fisher distribution and each cluster k is associated with cluster inherent parameters  œÅ   k  which includes cluster center Œº and cluster cohesion degree Œ∫. Then we adopt an EM-like approach (i.e., ùí´(  H  textbar  œÅ  ) and ùí´(  œÅ  textbar  H  ), respectively) to learn the embedding and cluster inherent parameters alternately. Specifically, with the node embeddings, we proposed to update the cluster centers in an attraction-repulsion manner to make the cluster centers more separable. And given the cluster inherent parameters, a likelihood-based loss is proposed to make node embeddings more concentrated around cluster centers. Thus, DAGC can simultaneously improve the intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster heterogeneity. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed DAGC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially on imbalanced datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Adaptive Graph Clustering via von Mises-Fisher Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yihang Zhou","Qingqing Long","Yuchen Yan","Xiao Luo","Zeyu Dong","Xuezhi Wang","Zhen Meng","Pengfei Wang","Yuanchun Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"a6cdbe7d2eabf03f1debd523b39d1c5b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhou-comae-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.947694Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhou-comae-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) has shown excellent success owing to its efficiency and generalization in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Also, the continuous-value attributes are not fully harnessed. In response, we conduct a COMprehensive Attribute Exploration for ZSH, named COMAE, which depicts the relationships from seen classes to unseen ones through three meticulously designed explorations, i.e., point-wise, pair-wise and class-wise consistency constraints. By regressing attributes from the proposed attribute prototype network, COMAE learns the local features that are relevant to the visual attributes. Then COMAE utilizes contrastive learning to comprehensively depict the context of attributes, rather than instance-independent optimization. Finally, the class-wise constraint is designed to cohesively learn the hash code, image representation, and visual attributes more effectively. Experimental results on the popular ZSH datasets demonstrate that COMAE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing techniques, especially in scenarios with a larger number of unseen label classes.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"title":"COMAE: COMprehensive Attribute Exploration for Zero-shot Hashing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Liu","Ren-Peng Chen","Xin Kang","Peng-Fei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"7164dbb0e6f81698ea4b01032a1c1817","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/liu-effect-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.785714Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-effect-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Compacted coal gangue is often used as subgrade soils in South Central China.

The effects of vertical load and compaction parameters on the soil deformation behaviours during hydraulic loading are fully discussed.

Experimental results also revealed that the variation in soil water content was more pronounced in the first D-W cycle. The characteristics of the void ratio and water content change during D-W cycles were investigated, and the shrinkage behaviour (e‚Äìw) was obtained. Significant hysteresis was detected during the D-W cycles, and the size of the hysteresis loop was found to decrease with the increase in D-W cycles, while it increased with the increase in vertical load.

In the real world, many facts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has received increasing attention. Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models in temporal KGQA, they still have several limitations. (I) They adopt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend to focus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporal constraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations of entities. (II) They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities nor explicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make it difficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling (QC-MHM) approach. Specifically, We first calibrate the question representation by fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG. Then, we construct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing. Finally, the question representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN to generate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmark dataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestions dataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% compared to the best-performing baseline. Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretable and trustworthy predictions.","tags":["Computer Science - Computation and Language"],"title":"Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling for Temporal Question Answering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingqing Long","Zheng Fang","Chen Fang","Chong Chen","Pengfei Wang","Yuanchun Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"09f100745a1c12fbe9e728803159b4bd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/long-unveiling-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.970596Z","relpermalink":"/publication/long-unveiling-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Traffic flow forecasting is a fundamental research issue for transportation planning and management, which serves as a canonical and typical example of spatial-temporal predictions. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved great success in capturing spatial-temporal correlations for traffic flow forecasting. Yet, two non-ignorable issues haven't been well solved: 1) The message passing in GNNs is immediate, while in reality the spatial message interactions among neighboring nodes can be delayed. The change of traffic flow at one node will take several minutes, i.e., time delay, to influence its connected neighbors. 2) Traffic conditions undergo continuous changes. The prediction frequency for traffic flow forecasting may vary based on specific scenario requirements. Most existing discretized models require retraining for each prediction horizon, restricting their applicability. To tackle the above issues, we propose a neural Spatial-Temporal Delay Differential Equation model, namely STDDE. It includes both delay effects and continuity into a unified delay differential equation framework, which explicitly models the time delay in spatial information propagation. Furthermore, theoretical proofs are provided to show its stability. Then we design a learnable traffic-graph time-delay estimator, which utilizes the continuity of the hidden states to achieve the gradient backward process. Finally, we propose a continuous output module, allowing us to accurately predict traffic flow at various frequencies, which provides more flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed STDDE along with competitive computational efficiency.","tags":["Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"Unveiling Delay Effects in Traffic Forecasting: A Perspective from Spatial-Temporal Delay Differential Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue Qiao","Pengyang Wang","Pengfei Wang","Zhiyuan Ning","Yanjie Fu","Yi Du","Yuanchun Zhou","Jianqiang Huang","Xian-Sheng Hua","Hui Xiong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"12f2479f0c24fad28c319c795b9f77ee","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/qiao-dual-channel-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.064397Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiao-dual-channel-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"This article studies the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs, which aims to incorporate ubiquitous unlabeled knowledge (e.g., graph topology, node attributes) with few-available labeled knowledge (e.g., node class) to alleviate the scarcity issue of supervised information on node classification. While promising results are achieved, existing works for this problem usually suffer from the poor balance of generalization and fitting ability due to the heavy reliance on labels or task-agnostic unsupervised information. To address the challenge, we propose a dual-channel framework for semi-supervised learning on Graphs via Knowledge Transfer between independent supervised and unsupervised embedding spaces, namely, GKT. Specifically, we devise a dual-channel framework including a supervised model for learning the label probability of nodes and an unsupervised model for extracting information from massive unlabeled graph data. A knowledge transfer head is proposed to bridge the gap between the generalization and fitting capability of the two models. We use the unsupervised information to reconstruct batch-graphs to smooth the label probability distribution on the graphs to improve the generalization of prediction. We also adaptively adjust the reconstructed graphs by encouraging the label-related connections to solidify the fitting ability. Since the optimization of the supervised channel with knowledge transfer contains that of the unsupervised channel as a constraint and vice versa, we then propose a meta-learning-based method to solve the bi-level optimization problem, which avoids the negative transfer and further improves the model‚Äôs performance. Finally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by comparing state-of-the-art algorithms.","tags":["meta learning","Social network"],"title":"A Dual-channel Semi-supervised Learning Framework on Graphs via Knowledge Transfer and Meta-learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zihao Li","Yunfan Xie","Wei Emma Zhang","Pengfei Wang","Lixin Zou","Fei Li","Xiangyang Luo","Chenliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"f35f8622c0ce37d1f51800fcc01cdb7d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/li-disentangle-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.955879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-disentangle-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Disentangle interest trend and diversity for sequential recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongjie Wang","Meng Xiao","Min Wu","Yuanchun Zhou","Yanjie Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"c94afa5cc52fd126536dae0386be6046","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-reinforcement-enhanced-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.897901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-reinforcement-enhanced-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reinforcement-enhanced autoregressive feature transformation: Gradient-steered search in continuous space for postfix expressions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Dong","Pengyang Wang","Meng Xiao","Zhiyuan Ning","Pengfei Wang","Yuanchun Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"3b8d0a45e4dc4db91b673868584b2262","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/dong-temporal-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.813663Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dong-temporal-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Temporal inductive path neural network for temporal knowledge graph reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuanming Hu","Wei Fan","Kun Yi","Pengfei Wang","Yuanbo Xu","Yanjie Fu","Pengyang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"c16c856d9be1e084076d51d0dc28c36f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/hu-boosting-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.080366Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hu-boosting-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Urban prediction tasks that aim to model the complicated spatial and temporal patterns of urban indicators (such as weather, vehicle charging demand, etc.) for accurate prediction, have been increasingly important in constructing smart cities and accelerating the urbanization process in the modern era. However, most existing works of urban prediction have only concentrated on spatial and temporal correlations, but ignored the effect of distribution shift from spatial and temporal perspectives; this could largely hinder the performance of urban prediction tasks. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a Shift-Aware Urban Prediction (SAUP) framework to eliminate the inherent shift effect among spatial-temporal urban time series data. Specifically, SAUP starts with a Shift Elimination Module, built upon our proposed Spatial-Temporal Attention Flows (STAF) composed of invertible attentions and coupling layers of normalizing flows in order to transform the raw shifted data into a unified distribution to remove the spatiotemporal shift. After the shift effect is eliminated, the Correlation Processing Module of SAUP further captures the core correlations to learn spatiotemporal dependencies, in which topological correlations and geographic correlations are jointly learned by GCN and CNN based on pre-defined graphs and extracted POI information. In addition, SAUP includes a model-agnostic Forecasting Module, which can be employed as any forecasting architecture to accomplish the predictions. To recover the raw distribution information, the output of the Forecasting Module is further taken for the inverse transformation of the Shift Elimination Module to produce the final forecasts. We have conducted extensive experiments in the SAUP framework, coupled with six state-of-the-art spatiotemporal forecasting models on two real-world datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated the consistent improvements of SAUP over the baseline algorithms.","tags":["Correlation","Couplings","Data mining","Forecasting","Normalizing Flows","Predictive models","Spatial Temporal Distribution Shift","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Task analysis","Urban Prediction"],"title":"Boosting Urban Prediction via Addressing Spatial-Temporal Distribution Shift","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

By representing numbers into a transition space, Num2vec can translates numbers agilely to different Internet of Things tasks through selecting the corresponding characteristics.

Our previous studies have demonstrated extraordinary suppressive efficacy of enterolactone (ENL) on EOC. A chemotherapeutic agent, trabectedin (Trabe), is shown to be effective on ovarian cancer, especially when combined with other therapeutics, such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or oxaliplatin. Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), a kind of matrix glycoprotein, plays important roles against cancer development through inhibiting angiogenesis but whether it is involved in the suppression of EOC by ENL or Trabe remains unknown. To test combined suppressive effects of ENL and Trabe on EOC and possible involvement of THBS1 in the anticancer activities of ENL and Trabe. The EOC cell line ES‚Äê2 was transfected with overexpressed THBS1 by lentivirus vector. We employed tube formation assay to evaluate the anti‚Äêangiogenesis activity of ENL and of its combined use with Trabe after THBS1 overexpression and established drug intervention and xenograft nude mouse cancer models to assess the in vivo effects of the hypothesized synergistic suppression between the agents and the involvement of THBS1. Mouse fecal samples were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing and microbiota analysis. We detected strong inhibitory activities of ENL and Trabe against the proliferation and migration of cancer cells and observed synergistic effects between ENL and Trabe in suppressing EOC. ENL and Trabe, given either separately or in combination, could suppress the tube formation capability of human microvascular endothelial cells, and this inhibitory effect became even stronger with THBS1 overexpression. In the ENL plus Trabe combination group, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 and cluster of differentiation 36 was both upregulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinase 9, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cluster of differentiation 47 were all decreased. With the overexpression of THBS1, the results became even more pronounced. In animal experiments, combined use of ENL and Trabe showed superior inhibitory effects to either single agent and significantly suppressed tumor growth, and the overexpression of THBS1 further enhanced the anti‚Äêcancer activities of the drug combination group. ENL and Trabe synergistically suppress EOC and THBS1 could remarkably facilitate the synergistic anticancer effects of ENL and Trabe.","tags":null,"title":"Enterolactone and trabectedin suppress epithelial ovarian cancer synergistically via upregulating textlessspan style=\\\"font-variant:small-caps;\\\"textgreaterTHBS1textless/spantextgreater","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Chenliang Li","Lixin Zou","Zhichao Feng","Kaiyuan Li","Xiaochen Li","Xialong Liu","Shangguang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696118400,"objectID":"cde33cbfa4cd9bf6306862e739542a86","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-tutorial-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.978916Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-tutorial-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tutorial: Data Denoising Metrics in Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujia Gao","Pengfei Wang","Liang Liu","Chi Zhang","Huadong Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"a90014a59783cf747a09b7df0ec51657","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/gao-configure-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.763301Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gao-configure-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning framework, enables clients to conduct model training without transmitting their data to the server, which is used to solve the dilemma of data silos and data privacy. It can work well on clients having similar data characteristics and distribution. However, it has some limitations where the dataset of clients may be different in distribution, quantity, and concept in many application scenarios. Personalized federated learning is a new federated learning paradigm that aims to guarantee client personalized models‚Äô effectiveness when collaborating with the cloud server. Intuitively, providing further facilitated collaborations for the clients with similar data characteristics and distribution can benefit personalized model building. However, due to the invisibility of client data, it is challenging to extract client characteristics and define collaborative relationships among them from a fine-grained view. Moreover, a reasonable collaborative training approach needs to be designed for a distributed server‚Äìclient framework. In this article, we design a Hierarchical Attention-enhanced Meta-learning Network¬†(HAM) to address this issue. The main advantage of HAM is that it utilizes the meta-learning approach of taking model parameters as features and learns to learn an extra model for each client to analyze similarities according to their local dataset automatically. According to its two-layers framework, HAM can reasonably achieve a tradeoff between clients‚Äô personality and commonality and provides a hybrid model with useful information from all clients. Considering there are two networks (HAM and base network) that need to learn for each client during the federated training process, we then provide an alternative learning approach to train them in an end-to-end fashion. To further clarify the approach, we describe the personalized federated learning settings framework as FedHAM where the HAM network is distributed deployed in each client. Extensive experiments based on two datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under different evaluation metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Configure Your Federation: Hierarchical Attention-enhanced Meta-Learning Network for Personalized Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyuan Ning","Pengfei Wang","Pengyang Wang","Ziyue Qiao","Wei Fan","Denghui Zhang","Yi Du","Yuanchun Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"701c38fbcfb5f53081abc2317b13d732","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ning-graph-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.904797Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ning-graph-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach in the realm of graph self-supervised learning. Prevailing GCL methods mainly derive from the principles of contrastive learning in the field of computer vision: modeling invariance by specifying absolutely similar pairs. However, when applied to graph data, this paradigm encounters two significant limitations: (1) the validity of the generated views cannot be guaranteed: graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and intrinsic topology of graph data; (2) specifying absolutely similar pairs in the graph views is unreliable: for abstract and non-Euclidean graph data, it is difficult for humans to decide the absolute similarity and dissimilarity intuitively. Despite the notable performance of current GCL methods, these challenges necessitate a reevaluation: Could GCL be more effectively tailored to the intrinsic properties of graphs, rather than merely adopting principles from computer vision? In response to this query, we propose a novel paradigm, Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL). This approach facilitates GCL via neighborhood ranking, avoiding the need to specify absolutely similar pairs. GSCL leverages the underlying graph characteristic of diminishing label consistency, asserting that nodes that are closer in the graph are overall more similar than far-distant nodes. Within the GSCL framework, we introduce pairwise and listwise gated ranking InfoNCE loss functions to effectively preserve the relative similarity ranking within neighborhoods. Moreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops considered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency. Our extensive empirical results across 11 commonly used graph datasets-including 8 homophily graphs and 3 heterophily graphs-demonstrate GSCL's superior performance compared to 20 SOTA GCL methods.","tags":["Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning via Neighborhood Ranking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaocan Zeng","Pengfei Wang","Yuren Mao","Lu Chen","Xiaoze Liu","Yunjun Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"e26c69db8d61ee644e08ffbfe15bc7d6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zeng-multiem-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.992594Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zeng-multiem-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Entity Matching (EM), which aims to identify all entity pairs referring to the same real-world entity from relational tables, is one of the most important tasks in real-world data management systems. Due to the labeling process of EM being extremely labor-intensive, unsupervised EM is more applicable than supervised EM in practical scenarios. Traditional unsupervised EM assumes that all entities come from two tables; however, it is more common to match entities from multiple tables in practical applications, that is, multi-table entity matching (multi-table EM). Unfortunately, effective and efficient unsupervised multi-table EM remains under-explored. To fill this gap, this paper formally studies the problem of unsupervised multi-table entity matching and proposes an effective and efficient solution, termed as MultiEM. MultiEM is a parallelable pipeline of enhanced entity representation, table-wise hierarchical merging, and density-based pruning. Extensive experimental results on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiEM in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","tags":["Computer Science - Computation and Language","Computer Science - Databases","Computer Science - Information Retrieval"],"title":"MultiEM: Efficient and Effective Unsupervised Multi-Table Entity Matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Teng-Yue Han","Peng-Fei Wang","Shao-Zhang Niu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"c40cb104751f3aeadeb15c8e9840638c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/han-multimodal-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.77838Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-multimodal-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal Interactive Network for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wayne Xin Zhao","Zihan Lin","Zhichao Feng","Pengfei Wang","Ji-Rong Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"eb987295545a3453d40b87967098ba3e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhao-revisiting-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.554703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhao-revisiting-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"In recommender systems, top- N recommendation is an important task with implicit feedback data. Although the recent success of deep learning largely pushes forward the research on top- N recommendation, there are increasing concerns on appropriate evaluation of recommendation algorithms. It therefore is important to study how recommendation algorithms can be reliably evaluated and thoroughly verified. This work presents a large-scale, systematic study on six important factors from three aspects for evaluating recommender systems. We carefully select 12 top- N recommendation algorithms and eight recommendation datasets. Our experiments are carefully designed and extensively conducted with these algorithms and datasets. In particular, all the experiments in our work are implemented based on an open sourced recommendation library, Recbole¬†[ 139 ], which ensures the reproducibility and reliability of our results. Based on the large-scale experiments and detailed analysis, we derive several key findings on the experimental settings for evaluating recommender systems. Our findings show that some settings can lead to substantial or significant differences in performance ranking of the compared algorithms. In response to recent evaluation concerns, we also provide several suggested settings that are specially important for performance comparison.","tags":null,"title":"A Revisiting Study of Appropriate Offline Evaluation for Top-N Recommendation Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Dong","Zhiyuan Ning","Pengyang Wang","Ziyue Qiao","Pengfei Wang","Yuanchun Zhou","Yanjie Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"3783f164625523975445a5d0a978d028","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/dong-adaptive-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.720645Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dong-adaptive-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict the future missing facts based on historical information and has gained increasing research interest recently. Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR.","tags":["Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Adaptive Path-Memory Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyuan Li","Pengfei Wang","Haitao Wang","Qiang Liu","Xingxing Wang","Dong Wang","Shangguang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"7c0b34ac4c905b94ced4816515dad751","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/li-communicative-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.000392Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-communicative-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Communicative MARL-based Relevance Discerning Network for Repetition-Aware Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Guo","Zhengxu Yu","Pengfei Wang","Zhongming Jin","Jianqiang Huang","Deng Cai","Xiaofei He","Xian-Sheng Hua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"51a348b8721021fbbdd641d9b485d0dc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-urban-2023/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.08922Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-urban-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Urban traffic light control is an important and challenging real-world problem. By regarding intersections as agents, most of the reinforcement learning-based methods generate agents‚Äô actions independently. They can cause action conflict and result in overflow or road resource waste in adjacent intersections. Recently, some collaborative methods have alleviated the above problems by extending the observable surroundings of agents, which can be considered inactive cross-agent communication methods. However, when agents act synchronously in these works, the perceived action value is biased, and the information exchanged is insufficient. In this work, we first propose a novel Multi-agent Communication and Action Rectification (MaCAR) framework. It enables active communication between agents by considering the impact of synchronous actions of agents. Another fundamental problem of traffic light control is the balance between traffic demand and road supply capacity. To fully describe the relation between traffic demand and road supply capacity (Supply-Demand modeling, SD), we further model and forecast the Supply-Demand relation to facilitating the effectiveness of the model‚Äôs action. The experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Combining the SD with MaCAR, SD-MaCAR can further boost the traffic light control performance even in traffic accident scenarios.","tags":["Accidents","Collaboration","Forecasting","Predictive

traffic speed prediction aims to estimate the future traffic speed for improving the urban transportation services. Enormous efforts have been made on exploiting spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed evolving patterns by leveraging explicit spatial relations (geographical proximity) through pre-defined geographical structures (it e.g., region grids or road networks). While achieving promising results, current traffic speed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring implicit spatial correlations (interactions), which cannot be captured by grid/graph convolutions. To tackle the challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling the current traffic speed prediction methods to preserve implicit spatial correlations. Specifically, we first develop a Dual-Transformer architecture, including a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer. The Spatial Transformer automatically learns the implicit spatial correlations across the road segments beyond the boundary of geographical structures, while the Temporal Transformer aims to capture the dynamic changing patterns of the implicit spatial correlations. Then, to further integrate both explicit and implicit spatial correlations, we propose a distillation-style learning framework, in which the existing traffic speed prediction methods are considered as the teacher model, and the proposed Dual-Transformer architectures are considered as the student model. The extensive experiments over three real-world datasets indicate significant improvements of our proposed framework over the existing methods.","tags":["Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"Boosting Urban Traffic Speed Prediction via Integrating Implicit Spatial Correlations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaizhou Zhang","Pengfei Wang","Lei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"f9b95678b2c17a4c17a03d098f87a6c7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhang-multi-round-2022/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.037052Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-multi-round-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Round Extraction and Dynamic Role Selection Framework For Document-Level Event Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqi Qin","Pengfei Wang","Biyu Ma","Zhe Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"4120f7adf4d30f38b531d83ee88b4f58","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/qin-multi-interest-2022/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.849734Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qin-multi-interest-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Multi-Interest Evolution Story: Applying Psychology in Query-based Recommendation for Inferring Customer Intention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunjun Gao","Xiaoze Liu","Junyang Wu","Tianyi Li","Pengfei Wang","Lu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"cd8eed33c94efbee5af6db5659ca0ea7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/gao-clusterea-2022/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.497607Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gao-clusterea-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ClusterEA: Scalable Entity Alignment with Stochastic Training and Normalized Mini-batch Similarities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyuan Li","Pengfei Wang","Chenliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"d3fdd80631a68c5f187b9de747956524","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/li-multi-agent-2022-1/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.043838Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-multi-agent-2022-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Agent RL-based Information Selection Model for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyuan Li","Pengfei Wang","Chenliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"4725f4f9c53380a25e95f72031a1b2ea","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/li-multi-agent-2022/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.856528Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-multi-agent-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Agent RL-based Information Selection Model for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Xiaocan Zeng","Lu Chen","Fan Ye","Yuren Mao","Junhao Zhu","Yunjun Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"cc91a18e6c772e62c627f8bbee40f086","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-promptem-2022/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.636393Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-promptem-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Entity Matching (EM), which aims to identify whether two entity records from two relational tables refer to the same real-world entity, is one of the fundamental problems in data management. Traditional EM assumes that two tables are homogeneous with the aligned schema, while it is common that entity records of different formats (e.g., relational, semi-structured, or textual types) involve in practical scenarios. It is not practical to unify their schemas due to the different formats. To support EM on format-different entity records, Generalized Entity Matching (GEM) has been proposed and gained much attention recently. To do GEM, existing methods typically perform in a supervised learning way, which relies on a large amount of high-quality labeled examples. However, the labeling process is extremely labor-intensive, and frustrates the use of GEM. Low-resource GEM, i.e., GEM that only requires a small number of labeled examples, becomes an urgent need. To this end, this paper, for the first time, focuses on the low-resource GEM and proposes a novel low-resource GEM method, termed as PromptEM. PromptEM has addressed three challenging issues (i.e., designing GEM-specific prompt-tuning, improving pseudo-labels quality, and running efficient self-training) in low-resource GEM. Extensive experimental results on eight real benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PromptEM in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","tags":["Computer Science - Databases"],"title":"PromptEM:

Resolution (ER) aims to identify whether two tuples refer to the same real-world entity and is well-known to be labor-intensive. It is a prerequisite to anomaly detection, as comparing the attribute values of two matched tuples from two different datasets provides one effective way to detect anomalies. Existing ER approaches, due to insufficient feature discovery or error-prone inherent characteristics, are not able to achieve stable performance. In this paper, we present CollaborER, a self-supervised entity resolution framework via multi-features collaboration. It is capable of (i) obtaining reliable ER results with zero human annotations and (ii) discovering adequate tuples' features in a fault-tolerant manner. CollaborER consists of two phases, i.e., automatic label generation (ALG) and collaborative ER training (CERT). In the first phase, ALG is proposed to generate a set of positive tuple pairs and a set of negative tuple pairs. ALG guarantees the high quality of the generated tuples and hence ensures the training quality of the subsequent CERT. In the second phase, CERT is introduced to learn the matching signals by discovering graph features and sentence features of tuples collaboratively. Extensive experimental results over eight real-world ER benchmarks show that CollaborER outperforms all the existing unsupervised ER approaches and is comparable or even superior to the state-of-the-art supervised ER methods.","tags":["Computer Science - Databases"],"title":"CollaborER: A Self-supervised Entity Resolution Framework Using Multi-features

Most existing graph-based CNNs attempt to capture the static relations while largely neglecting the dynamics underlying sequential data. In this article, we present dynamic spatio-temporal graph-based CNNs (DST-GCNNs) by learning expressive features to represent spatio-temporal structures and predict future traffic flows from surveillance video data. In particular, DST-GCNN is a two stream network. In the flow prediction stream, we present a novel graph-based spatio-temporal convolutional layer to extract features from a graph representation of traffic flows. Then several such layers are stacked together to predict future flows over time. Meanwhile, the relations between traffic flows in the graph are often time variant as the traffic condition changes over time. To capture the graph dynamics, we use the graph prediction stream to predict the dynamic graph structures, and the predicted structures are fed into the flow prediction stream. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performances compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.","tags":["Computational modeling","Convolution","convolutional neural network","Data models","Feature extraction","Forecasting","Graph neural networks","Predictive models","Sensors","spatio-temporal graph","time series regression","traffic forecasting"],"title":"Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph-Based CNNs for Traffic Flow Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Fan","Lei Zhang","Pengfei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"210dbd91c9728eb382bdf163cf7ac9da","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/dou-leveraging-2020/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.870107Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dou-leveraging-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Leveraging Label Semantics and Correlations for Judgment Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huidi Liu","Zheng Zeng","Mitra Afsharpad","Caiji Lin","Siwen Wang","Hao Yang","Shuhong Liu","Linda E.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively.

Utilization of data can benefit many applications, such as facilitate human daily life, promote scientific research, and expedite event detection etc. How to share data within a certain group or a specific person securely and effectively has become a hot research topic. Meanwhile, many distributed technologies have appeared with the triggering of many centralized cloud web services. Thus, we propose a block-chain based data sharing framework with IPFS (https://ipfs.io/), Ethereum (https://www.ethereum.org/) and uPort (https://www.uport.me/). As a result of this design, the system could store data in IPFS system and control sensitive data by block-chain, and the authentication can be managed by the uPort ID system. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness by a case study.","tags":["Blockchain","Data sharing","Decentralized system"],"title":"A Framework of Data Sharing System with Decentralized

appropriate features to represent a corpus is an important task for textual mining. Previous attention based work usually enhance feature at the lexical level, which lacks the exploration of feature augmentation at the sentence level. In this paper, we exploit a Dynamic Feature Generation Network (DFGN) to solve this problem. Specifically, DFGN generates features based on a variety of attention mechanisms and attaches features to sentence representation. Then a thresholder is designed to filter the mined features automatically. DFGN extracts the most significant characteristics from datasets to keep its practicability and robustness. Experimental results on multiple well-known answer selection datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We give a detailed analysis of the experiments to illustrate why DFGN provides excellent retrieval and interpretative ability.","tags":["Computer Science - Computation and Language","Computer Science - Information Retrieval"],"title":"Dynamic Feature Generation Network for Answer Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Ze Yang","Shuzi Niu","Yongfeng Zhang","Lei Zhang","ShaoZhang Niu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"4a3e102dd294c3f0f28ca6257523cfa2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-modeling-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.463703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-modeling-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Dynamic Pairwise Attention for Crime Classification over Legal Articles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Guannan Liu","Yanjie Fu","Yuanchun Zhou","Jianhui Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"cf51df5a020e8acb985d5e8b40b66c23","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-spotting-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.532954Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-spotting-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"What is the purpose of a trip? What are the unique human mobility patterns and spatial contexts in or near the pickup points and delivery points of trajectories for a specific trip purpose? Many prior studies have modeled human mobility patterns in urban regions; however, these analytics mainly focus on interpreting the semantic meanings of geographic topics at an aggregate level. Given the lack of information about human activities at pick-up and dropoff points, it is challenging to convert the prior studies into effective tools for inferring trip purposes. To address this challenge, in this article, we study large-scale taxi trajectories from an unsupervised perspective in light of the following observations. First, the POI configurations of origin and destination regions closely relate to the urban functionality of these regions and further indicate various human activities. Second, with respect to the functionality of neighborhood environments, trip purposes can be discerned from the transitions between regions with different functionality at particular time periods.  Along these lines, we develop a general probabilistic framework for spotting trip purposes from massive taxi GPS trajectories. Specifically, we first augment the origin and destination regions of trajectories by attaching neighborhood POIs. Then, we introduce a latent factor, POI Topic , to represent the mixed functionality of the regions, such that each origin or destination point in the city can be modeled as a mixture over POI Topics. In addition, considering the transitions from origins to destinations at specific time periods, the trip time is generated collaboratively from the pairwise POI Topics at both ends of the O-D pairs, constituting POI Links , and hence the trip purpose can be explained semantically by the POI Links. Finally, we present extensive experiments with the real-world data of New York City to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for spotting trip purposes, and moreover, the model is validated to perform well in predicting the destinations and trip time among all the baseline methods.","tags":null,"title":"Spotting Trip Purposes from Taxi Trajectories: A General Probabilistic Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Jiansheng Chen","Shaozhang Niu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5753601f2c81790229f766da68317c14","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-cfsh-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.748427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-cfsh-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"CFSH: Factorizing sequential and historical purchase data for basket recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongfeng Zhang","Qingyao Ai","Xu Chen","Pengfei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"2069248647014e293fdbfec0186047b0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhang-learning-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-01T12:09:50.72141Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-learning-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning over knowledge-base embeddings for recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Senlin Cheng","Liutong Xu","Pengfei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"37c4dfbdaf6651524e90731277d7a288","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/cheng-mir-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.117394Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cheng-mir-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mir: Multi-Task Intra-Representation Learning for Face Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinjun Yang","Pengfei Wang","Wei Fang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c1346023b2545ccd53653a332a2fcf15","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/yang-team-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:26.807053Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-team-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Team Formation with Relationship Strength Based on Meta Path in Heterogeneous Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengyang Wang","Yanjie Fu","Jiawei Zhang","Pengfei Wang","Yu Zheng","Charu Aggarwal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"bed80359adcf89d304fb49f36e01e3b8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-you-2018/","publishdate":"2024-03-01T12:09:50.741055Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-you-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"You are how you drive: Peer and temporal-aware representation learning for driving behavior analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongyan Yu","Pengfei Wang","Junping Mi","Xuliang Zhou","Jiaoqing Pan","Hui Wang","Liang Xie","Wei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"ba51a42d8d7db67648f2faccda24c267","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/yu-18-m-2017/","publishdate":"2024-03-02T12:16:27.057116Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yu-18-m-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We report a 1.8 Œºm widely tunable distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser with an over 11 nm continuous tuning range.
